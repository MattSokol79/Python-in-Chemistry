# Python-in-Chemistry
This is a collection of code that I am the most proud of that I wrote during the Python in Chemistry unit I took in my Master's year, the most enjoyable unit of my entire chemistry degree! The code includes functions for some common equations used in chemistry, including the ideal gas law and the energy minimum of a Lennard-Jones potential.
